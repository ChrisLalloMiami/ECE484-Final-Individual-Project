# ECE484 Final Individual Project

This is where I am hosting individual components of our ECE484 final project (Cardboard Pinball) with group members Chris Lallo, Blake Rile, Caroline Van Neste, and Mark Copeland. This repository houses the source code for the game's primary audio system, as well as on-field systems. See the Wiki for details.
